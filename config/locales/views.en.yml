          It is the aim of ‘where2help’ (w2h) clearly to present the needs for voluntary aid services of refugee-supporting organizations/initiatives for potential volunteer helpers.

          The goal of using w2h is optimally to match the requirements of refugee-supporting organizations and the offers by volunteer helpers.

          The operator of w2h is the “Fonds Soziales Wien” (Vienna Social Fund, abbreviated as FSW).

          The operator assumes no liability for the contents generated by users. Registration is necessary to use w2h.

          By registering, you consent to the terms of use, the data you specify being processed electronically and this data being passed on to registered users. Similarly, you agree to information being sent to your organization/initiative in relation to your volunteer work, especially in the event of acute emergencies.

          The FSW reserves the right not to accept organizations/initiatives into the w2h offer for significant reasons.

          The FSW also reserves the right to exclude registered organizations/initiatives from participating in w2h for significant reasons and to change or close w2h any time without prior notification and without specifying any grounds, in particular if this is necessary for legal and/or technical reasons.

          The organization/initiative may revoke its registration at w2h any time and without specifying any reasons.

          Registration does not produce any entitlement to use of w2h or employment of volunteer helpers.

          As a result of registration at w2h, volunteer helpers will be insured against accident and third-party liability while performing their volunteer work. Exceptions are professional or paid activities and voluntary assignments within the framework of an organization/initiative in possession of its own accident and third-party insurance for volunteers. Organizations/initiatives undertake to record all assignments with volunteers’ names, place of assignment, activity, date and time, to make a report to the operator immediately in the event of damages and to send the assignment data to <a href="mailto:contact@where2help.wien">contact@where2help.wien</a>.
