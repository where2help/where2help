          It is the aim of ‘where2help’ (w2h) clearly to present the needs for voluntary aid services of refugee-supporting organizations/initiatives for potential volunteer helpers.

          The goal of using w2h is optimally to match the requirements of refugee-supporting organizations and the offers by volunteer helpers.

          The operator of w2h is the “Fonds Soziales Wien” (Vienna Social Fund, abbreviated as FSW).

          The operator assumes no liability for the contents generated by users.

          Registration is necessary to use w2h.

          By registering, you consent to the data you specify being processed electronically and passed on to the organizations/initiatives concerned and seeking volunteer helpers via w2h. Similarly, you agree to information being sent to you in relation to your volunteer work, especially in the event of acute emergencies.

          You may revoke your registration at w2h any time and without specifying any reasons.

          Registration does not produce any entitlement to use of w2h or employment as a volunteer helper.

          The FSW reserves the right to exclude registered users from participating in w2h without specifying any reasons and to change or close w2h any time without prior notification and without specifying any grounds, in particular if this is necessary for legal and/or technical reasons.

          As a result of registration at w2h, users will be insured against accident and third-party liability while performing their volunteer work. Exceptions are professional or paid activities and voluntary assignments within the framework of an organization/initiative in possession of its own accident and third-party insurance for volunteers. Damages must be reported by the volunteer helper to the organization in question immediately. In the event of damages, you consent to your data, including the agreement to an assignment, being passed on to the insurance company.

          Reference to Google/Apple:
          w2h and the information contained therein are in no way connected to Google Inc. or Apple Inc. and are not in any way sponsored, supported or organized by Google Inc. or Apple Inc.
